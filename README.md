# Liberty County Clinic of Chiropractic

## Description 

This is a chiropractic website, designed and developed by me, for a local chiropractor. I created this using the MERN stack; but instead of React I used Gatsby.js for its speed. Additionally, Nodemailer is utilized to send emails via the contact form.

## Installation

To use this application, run 'npm install' to install all of the packages listed as dependencies for both the server and React.

## Usage 

The user must run `npm start` in order to start both the Express server and the Gatsby client simultaneously.

Instead of running locally, the application can also be ran here:
